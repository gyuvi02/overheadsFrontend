# OverheadsFrontend

**This hobby project is the frontend for my API "overheadBackend" and the product of my limited Angular knowledge + AI. In the app, tenants can record the various meter readings (gas, water, electricity). This is running on an nginx server on an Ubuntu cloud VPS**

This project was generated using Angular CLI version 19.2.10
